ðŸ§® App Development Task: Expense-Splitting Application
==============================================
Create an expense-splitting app similar to Settle Up or Splitwise that allows users to track and manage shared expenses effectively.

ðŸ“Œ Task Levels
The challenge is divided into four levels of increasing complexity.

ðŸ‘ž Level 0: Static Roll Dice UI
A single screen with a dice image in the center
A button below the dice that says "Roll Dice".
When the button is tapped, a new dice image should appear (static image swap). 
Clean UI with centered alignment.

ðŸ”° Level 1: Basic UI Development (Static)
Design the basic UI of the app.
Include screens for:
1. Adding expenses
2. Viewing balances
3. Settling payments
4. Focus on layout, navigation, and UI components without implementing any backend logic.

âš¡ Level 2: Functional App with API Integration
Make the UI fully responsive for different screen sizes.
Implement core functionality, including:
1. Adding and splitting expenses among multiple users.
2. Calculating who owes how much to whom.
3. Integrate a public API to support multiple currencies, allowing users to log expenses in different currencies and convert them dynamically.

ðŸš€ Level 3: Backend Integration & Data Storage
Use Firebase or another backend service to store user data, expenses, and balances.
Implement user authentication (Google sign-in, email/password, etc.).
Display data in a well-structured way and ensure real-time updates when expenses are added or settled.
Implement local storage for offline support.

ðŸ’¯ Level 4: OCR for Automated Expense Entry
Integrate OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to scan bills and extract text automatically.
Allow users to capture receipts and auto-fill expense details like amount, date, and category.
Optimize OCR to handle different receipt formats and currencies.
